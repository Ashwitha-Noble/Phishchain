# PHISHING PERCEPTION & PREDICTION
Phishing is a type of online fraud where attackers attempt to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information, through email, text messages, or fake websites. Prediction of phishing refers to the use of machine learning algorithms or other methods to predict and detect phishing attempts before they can be successful. This can include analyzing email content, sender information, and website characteristics to determine the likelihood that it is a phishing attempt.
